.. important::
    Niamoto is currently in active development and thus not ready for
    production use. If you are interested in the project and willing to
    contribute or collaborate feel free to contact.

Niamoto is an ecological data warehouse framework, it aims to provide a
flexible and efficient platform for decision support in ecosystems and
biodiversity conservation.

Niamoto is funded by the COGEFOR projet in New Caledonia, which is a
partnership between the North Province of New Caledonia, the New Caledonian
Agronomic Institute (IAC) and the CIRAD. The AMAP joint research unit and the
IRD are also implied in the project.
